Hello there, thanks for checking out my SQL projects.
In this thread three files are included, for different purposes.

The DA practical exam is included there for its rather complicated data cleaning task, which is not found in the projects I do later.

The SQL practical exam is all that, along with database schemas and an understanding of database design.

Finally, International debt statistics is a practical project I did under the World Bank Database to show my skills in the real world.
